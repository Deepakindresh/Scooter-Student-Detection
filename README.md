# Scooter-Student-Detection
My first project at UCR, where we identify scooters inside a class environment as it is illegal to bring scooters to class and also count the number of students in class to find out who is proxying.

The link to our data can be found on Roboflow where we manually clicked pictures in our college and labelled them using Roboflow's Polygon Annotation tool.
We used Yolov8 since it is one of the best and latest Object detection models out there.

All the results can be seen in the COLAB file and if you would like to run this project you would need to run the test.py file after installing all the dependencies that are required to run Yolov8.
